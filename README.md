# Gender-Classification-with-CNN
Classification model for Gender identification (Only Male and Female classes)

## About the dataset
The data set is of cropped images of male and female . It is split into training and validation directory. Training contains ~23,000 images of each class and validation directory contains ~5,500 images of each class.

## Implementation accuracy
<b>Train set accuracy:</b> ~94%<br/>
<b>Validation set accuracy :</b> 93.05%<br/>

The accuracy is quite good. The model was trained for 30 epochs. With a bit of tweaking of models layers, dropouts, increasing the number of filters etc and training the model for 100 epochs or more will result in very high accuracy.
